Introduction to Web Development Basics
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a web page and its content using a markup.

Creating an HTML Page
To create an HTML page, you simply need to write HTML code in a text editor and save the file with a .html extension.

Markup Language
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. It uses tags to define elements within a document.

DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programs to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web pages dynamically.

Element / Tag
An element, also known as a tag, is a fundamental building block of an HTML document. It consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements define the structure and semantics of a web page's content.

Attribute
Attributes provide additional information about an element and are specified within the opening tag. They can modify the behavior or appearance of an element.

Browser Loading Process
When a browser loads a webpage, it follows a series of steps including DNS resolution, establishing a connection with the server, requesting and receiving the page content, parsing HTML, rendering the DOM, executing JavaScript, and applying CSS styles.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or spoken.

Adding Style to an Element
To add style to an HTML element, you can use inline styles, internal styles within the <style> tag, or external stylesheets linked using the <link> tag.

Class
A class is an attribute that allows you to apply a specific style or behavior to multiple elements. It allows you to group elements together and apply styles to them collectively.

Selector
A selector is a pattern used to select elements on an HTML page that you want to style with CSS. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and relationship with other elements.

CSS Specificity Value
CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when multiple rules conflict. It is calculated based on the type of selector, IDs, classes, and inline styles. The higher the specificity value, the more precedence the rule has.

Box Properties in CSS
Box properties in CSS refer to properties that control the layout and dimensions of an element's rectangular box. This includes properties like width, height, padding, margin, border, and positioning.
